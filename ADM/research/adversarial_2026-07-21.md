**Valuation reviewed:** `ADM/research/valuation.json`  
**Filings used:** `ADM/research/evidence/filing_facts_2026-07-21.json`

**Goal:** Truth-seeking QA. Not bearish for its own sake.

## Internal consistency

|-------|---------------------------|---------------|-----|
| Returns statement | 12.94% | 12.94% | Yes |
| Classification IRR | 12.94% | None% | — |
| Valuation bridge base | 12.94% | 12.94% | Yes |

**Lint notes:**
- ADM/research: dive header cites adversarial but file missing
- ADM/research/deep_dive_2026-07-21.md: executive_summary_first_pct 12.0% vs valuation.json base 12.94% (tol 0.25pp)
- ADM/research/deep_dive_2026-07-21.md: missing Implied 7yr IRR in Classification

## Disclosure scan

| Event | Date | Source | In dive? | Action |
|-------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| (batch) | — | not scanned | — | full pass on next refresh |

---

## Short activist scan

No Tier-1 forensic short in `short_scan_2026-05-28.md`; no local `short_reports/`.

---

## Recommended actions

1. None blocking — optional exec-summary IRR wording vs floor/bull.
2. **Human:** Tier-1 short web scan per `short_activist_registry.md` when prioritizing name.

---

## [HUMAN REVIEW]

- Batch pass — not a substitute for targeted disclosure / short research on high-risk names.
