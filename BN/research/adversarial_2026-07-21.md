# BN — Adversarial review

**Date:** 2026-07-21  
**Agent:** Milly (batch pass)  
**Dive reviewed:** `BN/research/deep_dive_2026-07-21.md`  
**Valuation reviewed:** `BN/research/valuation.json`  
**Filings used:** `BN/research/evidence/filing_facts_2026-07-21.json`

**Goal:** Truth-seeking QA. Not bearish for its own sake.

| Filing reconciliation | pass | filing_facts spot-check |
| Internal consistency | fail | lint_adversarial |

## Internal consistency

| Check | Expected (valuation.json) | Found in dive | OK? |
|-------|---------------------------|---------------|-----|
| Returns statement | 14.28% | 14.28% | Yes |
| Classification IRR | 14.28% | -1.79% | **No** |
| Valuation bridge base | 14.28% | 14.28% | Yes |

**Lint notes:**
- BN/research/deep_dive_2026-07-21.md: classification -1.79% vs valuation.json base 14.28% (tol 0.25pp)

## Disclosure scan

| Event | Date | Source | In dive? | Action |
|-------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| (batch) | — | not scanned | — | full pass on next refresh |

---

## Short activist scan

No Tier-1 forensic short in `short_scan_2026-05-28.md`; no local `short_reports/`.

---

## Recommended actions

1. **Marvin:** Align Returns statement / Classification IRR with `valuation.json` base.
2. **Human:** Tier-1 short web scan per `short_activist_registry.md` when prioritizing name.

---

## [HUMAN REVIEW]

- Batch pass — not a substitute for targeted disclosure / short research on high-risk names.
