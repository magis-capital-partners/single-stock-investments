## Dashboard

Static portfolio dashboard (etf-dashboard styling) in [`dashboard/`](dashboard/).

**Equity model viz:** Click a ticker with an **M** badge (pilot `7176.T`) to view earnings model charts in the detail panel. Rebuild: `python _system/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py` (includes model ingest). Spec: [`_system/prompts/dashboard_equity_model_viz.md`](_system/prompts/dashboard_equity_model_viz.md). **v2 upgrade (R², PM diagnostics):** [`_system/prompts/equity_model_v2_pm_diagnostics.md`](_system/prompts/equity_model_v2_pm_diagnostics.md).

**Darwin IRA:** [Research download plan](_system/frameworks/darwin_ira_research_plan.md) · copy PDF: `_system/scripts/copy_darwin_investor_pdf.ps1`

**Darwin tab (phases 0–4):** [Adaptive portfolio layer](_system/frameworks/darwin_portfolio_tab_proposal.md) · [Source alignment](_system/frameworks/darwin_source_alignment.md) — Holdings | **Darwin** on the dashboard. Rebuild:

```powershell
pip install -r _system/scripts/requirements-darwin.txt
python3 _system/scripts/build_darwin_portfolio.py --download
python3 _system/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py
```

Use `--fast` for CI-speed training. Reference PDFs: [`_system/reference/quant-evolution/`](_system/reference/quant-evolution/).

**Warrants tab:** Contract-first monitor for post-reorganization and de-SPAC
warrants. The tab separates the verified series registry from the raw SEC
event inbox and withholds executable scoring until identity, issuer survival,
and two-sided-market gates all pass. Refresh and validate locally:

```powershell
make warrant-refresh
make warrant-check
```

Monday discovery is part of `data-pipeline.yml`; nightly dashboard rebuilds
refresh delayed marks, preserve last-known-good data on vendor failure, and
capture monthly point-in-time cohorts for 90/365-day outcome calibration.

**Local preview:**

```powershell
python _system/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py
cd dashboard
python -m http.server 8765
```

## Investment Committee

Deterministic, multi-persona review that gates a stock-specific Power Zone valuation before any stance becomes actionable. Each persona is a specialist error-checking lens (Marathon capital-cycle, Marks credit-cycle, Klarman asset-value, Pabrai asymmetry/downside, Greenblatt event) that must abstain unless its required inputs are measurable. A mandatory pre-mortem artifact precedes round-1 votes; the committee's evidence set is **frozen** (locked to a `packet_hash`) for the duration of a round so votes stay comparable — a refresh restarts the round. Generic screening models cannot enter committee review. Dissent is preserved; agents never size capital, they only route a recommendation toward `human_decision.json`.

Driven by [`investment-committee.yml`](.github/workflows/investment-committee.yml): `select_committee_work.py` → `committee_task_queue.py` (materializes deterministic stages, writes `proposer.json`) → `investment_committee_pipeline.py validate/assemble` → commits `{TICKER}/research/committee_{date}.json`. See [`investment_committee_personas.md`](_system/frameworks/investment_committee_personas.md) and [`investment_process.md`](_system/frameworks/investment_process.md) §5.

## Contract backfill

Contract v3 separates proof completeness from investment readiness. A contract may be technically `decision_grade` while its `model_level` remains `screening_grade`; only a stock-specific, evidence-clear model is committee-eligible. Every method also declares an `output_basis`: a `present_value_today` publishes intrinsic value and margin of safety but no forward return or hurdle entry price; only a dated `future_payoff` or `forward_cashflow_schedule` can publish a forward return. The former present-value/price annualization survives only under `legacy_audit` and is never actionable.

`python _system/scripts/build_contract_backfill_queue.py` writes the proof-repair queue ([`contract_backfill_queue.json`](_system/data/contract_backfill_queue.json)). `zero_value_policy` (in [`universal_valuation_contract.py`](_system/scripts/universal_valuation_contract.py)) permits zero only with explicit `evidence_refs` and `allowed: true`. Authority precedence — `human_decision → investment_committee → universal_valuation_contract → legacy` — is resolved solely by [`decision_authority.py`](_system/scripts/decision_authority.py). The full contract and Tier 1/2/3 operating design is in [`valuation-contract-v3-and-universe-tiers.md`](docs/valuation-contract-v3-and-universe-tiers.md).

## Short Alpha

Systematic short-idea research ledger. Each filing is partitioned into five falsifiable, source-addressable claim types (identity/instrument, financial oxygen/liquidity runway, earnings quality, operating failure mode, market mechanics — borrow, days-to-cover, catalyst window) per [`short_alpha_filing_furnace.md`](_system/frameworks/short_alpha_filing_furnace.md). Build/refresh:

```powershell
python _system/scripts/build_short_alpha_dashboard.py   # reads short_alpha_research_queue.json → dashboard/data/short_alpha.json (--check to validate only)
python _system/scripts/refresh_short_alpha_borrow.py     # borrow / split-aware entry data → dashboard/data/short_alpha_borrow.json
```

Rendered via [`dashboard/short-alpha-viz.js`](dashboard/short-alpha-viz.js).

## LS-Algo systematic flows

Nightly Power Zone valuation pipeline for the Darwin portfolio's systematic/volatility-flow ("LS-Algo") sleeve: build power zones → route method → valuation workbench → entry pricing from dated future economics, when available → gated IC review for stock-specific eligible models only → dashboard refresh.

```powershell
python _system/scripts/darwin/run_ls_algo_equity_onboard_all.py   # onboard new underlyings
python _system/scripts/darwin/build_ls_algo_underlying_gap.py     # find coverage gaps
python _system/scripts/darwin/run_ls_algo_valuation_pipeline.py   # nightly valuation run (wired into ci_rebuild_profile.py --full)
```

Plan: [`ls_algo_power_zone_valuation_plan_2026-07-17.md`](_system/proposals/ls_algo_power_zone_valuation_plan_2026-07-17.md). Scheduled via [`ls-algo-universe.yml`](.github/workflows/ls-algo-universe.yml).

## Market risk / criticality-flow monitor

Daily LPPLS (log-periodic power law singularity) ensemble bubble/crash-risk snapshots for major US/global risk proxies, rates/credit proxies, and 11 sector ETFs, plus an optional live intraday Databento minute-bar feed. Research-only — no trading authority.

```powershell
python _system/scripts/build_criticality_signals.py --workers 4   # daily build; --symbols to subset
```

Runs after the daily fear/capitulation refresh via [`market-risk-components.yml`](.github/workflows/market-risk-components.yml); data ships to Cloudflare D1 over HMAC-signed ingestion and serves through `/api/v1/market-risk/*` as a dashboard risk rail + sector heatmap. Local always-on install (Windows Scheduled Task, every 30 min during market hours + EOD): `_system/scripts/install_market_risk_component_task.ps1`. Runbook: [`docs/criticality-flow-monitor-runbook.md`](docs/criticality-flow-monitor-runbook.md), [`docs/market-risk-component-pipeline.md`](docs/market-risk-component-pipeline.md).

## Respiratory demand KPI (QDEL)

Weekly US respiratory-virus testing volumes (influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2 — CDC FluView via Delphi Epidata, plus CDC NAAT panel `rgnm-fkqb`; both keyless) plus a validated revenue model, rendered as a full panel on the dashboard **Insights → Inflections** tab: metric strip, actual-vs-fitted chart with forward band, and the candidate ladder that shows the negative result rather than hiding it.

Carried as **labelled context, not a revenue driver**. Out-of-sample testing found no incremental forecasting value: every specification carrying a flu/RSV/COVID term scored worse under leave-one-out CV than the same model without it, and the one variant that beat the naive baseline failed a permutation test (p=0.24). The shipped baseline for QuidelOrtho respiratory revenue is `log(revenue) ~ seasonal dummies + trend` — 38% better than a seasonal-naive benchmark, with no testing term at all. The candidate ladder stays in the output so the conclusion is falsifiable as the sample grows.

```powershell
python _system/scripts/fetch_respiratory_panel.py        # weekly panel -> _system/reference/market-data/respiratory/
python _system/scripts/build_qdel_respiratory_model.py   # baseline + diagnostics -> QDEL/research/respiratory_model.json
python _system/scripts/build_kpi_trends.py               # context row on the KPI tab
```

Method, guardrails, and what would actually raise predictability: [`docs/respiratory-kpi.md`](docs/respiratory-kpi.md).

## BTC snowball / World Model panel

Dashboard panel presenting a Bitcoin power-law/snowball demand-and-cost-floor model in plain English with a supporting chart. Implemented directly in [`dashboard/insights-viz.js`](dashboard/insights-viz.js) (search `hk-snowball`) — no separate framework doc.

### Marvin pipeline (local = cloud)

1. **Narrative** — filing-grounded write per `_system/prompts/cloud_marvin_runbook.md` and `deep_dive_structure.md`
2. **Mechanical** — one command:

```powershell
python _system/scripts/marvin_cloud_refresh.py TICKER --date 2026-05-29
```

3. **All holdings** — `python _system/scripts/batch_portfolio_refresh.py --date 2026-05-29`

The authoritative valuation close is `python _system/scripts/run_security_decision_pipeline.py --scope all`. Marvin remains the evidence/narrative coordinator; Power Zones route methods and reviewers, the universal contract controls readiness, and only `human_decision.json` authorizes capital.

**Do not mix valuation languages:**

| Canonical (production) | Legacy reference (not actionable) |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Power Zone route → proof-first components → `valuation_contract.json` → IC → `human_decision.json` | Marvin/Lawrence `implied_return`, `stance_proposal`, “Thesis IRR” fallbacks |

Resolver: [`decision_authority.py`](_system/scripts/decision_authority.py). Detail: [`proof_first_valuation.md`](_system/frameworks/proof_first_valuation.md) § *Do not mix two valuation languages*.

Valuation arithmetic is proof-first: source-locked facts and bounded assumptions flow through deterministic calculation graphs, while unsupported ranges are excluded as legacy sensitivities. Contract v3 keeps intrinsic value, margin of safety, and forward return as separate concepts; a present value is never annualized or discounted a second time. See the approved [`valuation_method_registry.json`](_system/reference/valuation_method_registry.json) and the [`Contract v3 and universe-tier plan`](docs/valuation-contract-v3-and-universe-tiers.md).

**INDEX.csv:** prefer per-ticker regen: `python _system/scripts/build_folder_indexes.py --ticker SNOW` (avoid full-portfolio regen unless intentional).

**Dropbox research ingestion:** source-preserving bulk intake for the Stahl/Horizon Kinetics and SumZero Dropbox folders lives in [`_system/frameworks/dropbox_ingestion.md`](_system/frameworks/dropbox_ingestion.md). Run `python _system/scripts/dropbox_ingest.py --stahl-password stahl`; raw archives stay local while manifests, indexes, extracted text, and summaries are written under `_system/dropbox_ingestion/`.

**SumZero Insights bridge:** `python _system/scripts/build_sumzero_index.py` scans the local `~/Downloads/SumZero Ideas.zip` archive, writes a compact committed index at `_system/reference/data-sources/sumzero_ideas_index.json`, and feeds matched holdings/watchlist ideas into the dashboard Insights tab. Raw SumZero documents stay local/ignored; `make persona-insights` refreshes the index before rebuilding dashboard data.

**Letter → ticker consensus pipeline (dataroma-style):** evidence-tiered matching that resolves superinvestor-letter mentions to a canonical security universe and aggregates a cross-fund consensus. Run in order:

```powershell
python _system/scripts/build_security_master.py        # canonical universe: book + Tier-A symbols harvested from letters
python _system/scripts/build_superinvestor_insights.py # tiered per-letter mentions, fund_id + real letter dates
python _system/scripts/calibrate_letter_dates.py --gold  # letter date parser gate (_eval/letter_date_gold.jsonl)
python _system/scripts/calibrate_letter_matching.py --gold  # precision/recall gate vs _eval/gold.jsonl (must PASS)
python _system/scripts/build_insights.py               # adds the consensus block (most-discussed / activity / by-ticker)
python _system/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py          # ticker payload; insights load from dashboard/data/insights.json
```

Matching logic lives in [`letter_matching.py`](_system/scripts/letter_matching.py) (Tier A = explicit ticker syntax, Tier B = verified company name; word/benchmark/credential collisions are gated out). Curate funds in [`_system/reference/superinvestor-letters/funds.json`](_system/reference/superinvestor-letters/funds.json) (uncurated letters are grouped deterministically and listed in `funds_unresolved.json`). The dashboard **Insights → Consensus** tab renders the result with quarter/book/search facets. Current calibration: precision 0.97 / recall 0.94.

### Cursor models and billing

| Context | Model | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **IDE Composer** (local Marvin chat) | Your Cursor setting (e.g. Composer 2.5) | Uses your plan’s Composer allowance |
| **Research coordinator** | `composer-2.5` in `marvin_deep_dive.mjs` | One evidence-changed ticker/day through the shared admission gate |
| **Investment Committee** | `composer-2.5` | Five-call baseline; up to nine only on evidence or disagreement escalation |
| **Vicki / CI Autofix** | `composer-2.5` | Exception-only, with cooldown, deduplication, and daily budgets |
| **Python scripts** | No LLM | Power Zone router, universal contract/workbench, pricing gates, dashboard build; `marvin_valuation` is compatibility-only |

All active cloud consumers use the shared policy, stable evidence hashes, append-only audit ledgers, pinned SDK lockfiles, and `npm ci`. See [`_system/frameworks/llm_token_governance.md`](_system/frameworks/llm_token_governance.md).

Push to `main` after downloads or research triggers a Pages deploy automatically when dashboard-related paths change.

**Onboard → research:** Dashboard **+ Add holding** triggers deterministic scaffold/download, then the shared dispatcher. A cloud PR starts only when an evidence manifest is ready and not previously processed. See `_system/frameworks/onboard_research_automation.md`.

**Daily analysis loop:** Data Pipeline refreshes holdings and news; after a successful download stage, `daily-sync` asks the dispatcher for at most one eligible holding. Unchanged evidence, duplicate hashes, cooldowns, and the one-call daily budget all suppress Cursor.

### Secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions)

| Secret | Required for | How to get |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | Drive intake + PDF store sync; Cloud Grok VIC drop | Full service-account JSON for `pdf-store-uploader@single-stock-pdf-store.iam.gserviceaccount.com`. GitHub Actions **and** [Cursor Cloud Agents → Secrets](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents) (JSON contents; `.cursor/environment.json` writes the file). Folder access is already on the Shared Drive |
| `RESEARCH_VAULT_REPO_URL` | Letter backfill + insight rebuilds | `https://github.com/magis-capital-partners/research-vault.git` |
| `RESEARCH_VAULT_CLONE_TOKEN` | Clone/push private vault from CI | Fine-grained PAT with **Contents read+write** on `research-vault` |
| `CURSOR_API_KEY` | Gated research, committee judgment, IR adapter repair, and narrow CI autofix | [Cursor Dashboard → Integrations](https://cursor.com/dashboard/integrations) |
| `HK_PDFS_ROOT` | Optional — full HK vault on cloud agent VM (default `/opt/cursor/hk_pdfs`) | [Cursor Dashboard → Cloud Agents → Secrets](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents); see `_system/frameworks/hk_cross_reference.md` |

### Local publish

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _system/scripts/publish_github.ps1
```

Rebuilds dashboard JSON and pushes to `main`. Pages deploy runs via GitHub Actions (no second repo).

### Marvin session → GitHub

After local Marvin work:

```powershell
python _system/scripts/build_dashboard_data.py
git add -A
git commit -m "research: YOUR_MESSAGE"
git push origin main
```

Cloud research begins from the evidence-change queue and opens a reviewable PR automatically; the Actions tab has no manual mode or ticker selector.

Dashboard links use **filename date** (not mtime) for latest `deep_dive_*.md` / `adversarial_*.md`.

### Public repo note

This repo contains portfolio research and ticker theses. Licensed letter/HK corpora are in the private **`research-vault`** repo. Review GitHub Pages access separately before assuming dashboard data is private.

For unlimited GitHub Actions minutes, the **operational** repo can be made public (vault stays private). See `_system/reference/research-vault-split.md`.
