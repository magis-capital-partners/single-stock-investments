**Valuation reviewed:** `HIMS/research/valuation.json`  
**Filings used:** `HIMS/research/evidence/filing_facts_2026-07-18.json`

|-------|---------------------------|---------------|-----|

| Classification IRR | 2.1% | 2.1% | Yes |
| Valuation bridge base | 2.1% | 2.1% | Yes |

**Lint notes:**
- HIMS/research: dive header cites adversarial but file missing

## Disclosure scan

| Event | Date | Source | In dive? | Action |
|-------|------|--------|----------|--------|
| (batch) | — | not scanned | — | full pass on next refresh |

---

## Short activist scan

No Tier-1 forensic short in `short_scan_2026-05-28.md`; no local `short_reports/`.

---

## Recommended actions

1. None blocking — optional exec-summary IRR wording vs floor/bull.
2. **Human:** Tier-1 short web scan per `short_activist_registry.md` when prioritizing name.

---

## [HUMAN REVIEW]

- Batch pass — not a substitute for targeted disclosure / short research on high-risk names.
