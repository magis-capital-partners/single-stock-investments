# Short activist / forensic research registry

**Machine-readable registry:** `_system/frameworks/activist_firm_registry.json` (long + short firms).

**Purpose:** Milly (adversarial reviewer) scans these publishers for reports on **portfolio tickers**. Not every name has coverage on every holding.

**Use:** Cross-reference only. A short report is **evidence to reconcile**, not a veto. Goal = **truth**, not bearishness for its own sake.

## Reconciliation rules (Milly)

1. **If short report exists:** Summarize **falsifiable claims** (numbers, accounting, legal).
2. **Check each claim** against latest 10-K/10-Q or local equivalent in `{TICKER}/investor-documents/`.
3. **Map to Marvin dive:** Did the deep dive address it? If not → **gap** (not auto-downgrade).
4. **Verdict types:** `refuted_by_filing` | `partially_valid` | `unaddressed` | `stale` | `needs_human`
5. **Do not** change stance or IRR without human review unless **factual error** in Marvin numbers (lint-level).

## Maintenance

- Add new firms when human discovers quality forensic work.
- Mark **inactive** firms; keep for historical tickers.
- Store found reports in `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/activist_reports/{long|short}/` with metadata in `activist_reports_index.json`.
- Markdown summaries may also live in `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/short_reports/` with `source`, `date`, `url`, `summary.md`.
