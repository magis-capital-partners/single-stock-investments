# Mental Models Catalog

**Purpose:** Reference appendix for Marvin research. **Workflow:** read `_system/frameworks/decision_stack.md` first — not this entire file on every dive.

**Sources:** `_system/reference/investment-wisdom/` (Munger, Pabrai, Stahl, Horizon Kinetics)  
**Approved beliefs:** `_system/memory/MEMORY.md` (human-promoted only)  
**Classification axes:** `_system/frameworks/classification.md`  
**Tier 2 by archetype:** `_system/frameworks/archetype_models.json`

Each model has: **Trigger** (when to apply), **Question** (what to ask), **Tier** (priority).

---

## How to use

1. **Every deep dive:** run Tier 1 + archetype Tier 2 models.
2. **If trigger matches:** run relevant Tier 3 models; tag report with **Predictive attribute** (see below).
3. **Cite sources** by path — not training memory alone.
4. **Propose new models** as `[PROPOSED]` in daily log; human promotes to `MEMORY.md`.

### Predictive attribute tag (optional report field)

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `equity_yield_curve` | Known/predictable future value + timeline; institutional time horizon creates discount |
| `dormant_asset` | Hidden value not in earnings multiple |
| `market_structure_discount` | Index/yield/K-1/small-cap exclusion misprices security |
| `transitory_problem` | Temporary, bounded operational or cash-flow interruption |
| `none` | No Tier 3 HK predictive attribute identified |

## Tier 1 — Universal (every deep dive)

| Model | Genius | Trigger | Question |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| **Latticework** | Munger | Always | Am I using models from multiple disciplines, or collecting isolated facts? |
| **Inversion** | Munger | Always | What would make this fail? Can we survive being wrong? |
| **Incentive-caused bias** | Munger | Management / operator assessment | Who gets paid for what? Does their incentive match unit-holder economics? |
| **Circle of competence** | Munger | Always | Can I explain this business in five plain sentences? If not, pass or defer. |
| **Psychology checklist** | Munger | Thesis challenge, cross-checks | Which of ~25 misjudgment tendencies are active? Any lollapalooza combination? |
| **Dhando asymmetry** | Pabrai | Always | Is this heads I win, tails I don't lose much — or am I paying for heroic assumptions? |
| **Simplicity** | Pabrai | Always | Is the business simple enough that I need not rely on a single fragile variable? |
| **Fat pitch discipline** | Pabrai | Sizing / stance | Am I forcing a trade, or waiting for margin of safety? |
| **Lawrence 5 questions** | Lawrence | Always | Understand, durable cash flow, aligned mgmt, cheap vs cash flow, why cheap? |
| **10-year IRR** | Lawrence | Modelable FCF / owner earnings | What IRR does today's price imply on a 10-year base case? |
| **IRR vs price** | Lawrence | After material price move | Did implied IRR cross 15% or 20%? Update stance? |
| **New idea bar** | Lawrence | Watchlist → onboard | Is IRR clearly above portfolio median *and* above weakest incumbent? |
| **MOI three questions** | Mihaljevic | Every deep dive | Inefficiency source, margin of safety, path to value creation named? |
| **Uses & misuses** | Mihaljevic | Every deep dive | Characteristic failure modes for this `moi_bucket` documented? |

**Sources:** `munger/Munger-1994-Elementary-Worldly-Wisdom.pdf`, `munger/Psychology-of-Human-Misjudgment.pdf`, `pabrai/` partner letters; `mihaljevic/Manual-of-Ideas-chapter-reference.txt`; `_system/frameworks/lawrence_irr.md` (Oakcliff / Bryan Lawrence).

## Tier 2 — Archetype-specific

### Stahl — Croupier / exchange / index infrastructure

| Model | Trigger | Question |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Croupier toll** | Archetype = croupier | Does this facilitate pecuniary transactions without principal balance-sheet risk? |
| **Volume vs share** | Exchanges | Is handled volume growing even if market share slips? |
| **Fee model resilience** | Exchanges | Ad valorem (cyclical with markets) or per-trade/volume (more resilient)? |
| **Cycle normalization** | Croupiers with Cycle tag | Are current earnings peak / mid / trough vs normalized activity? |
| **Real diversification** | Portfolio scans | Are we mistaking cap-weight breadth for economic diversification? |

**Sources:** `stahl/Stahl-Croupier-Business-Model-2008.pdf`, `stahl/Stahl-Exchanges-Less-Talk-More-Figures-2009.pdf`, `stahl/Stahl-Achievement-of-Diversification-2020.pdf`

### Stahl — Corporate structure

| Model | Trigger | Question |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Spinoff / simplification** | Conglomerate, forced separation | Does complexity hide segment economics that separation would reveal? |

**Sources:** `stahl/Stahl-Spinoffs-Going-Separate-Ways-2015.pdf`

### Hohn — Operating mechanics & valuation bridge

Apply on **every deep dive** under Business mechanics. Full template: `_system/frameworks/hohn_business_analysis.md`.

| Model | Trigger | Question |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Operating snapshot** | Always | What changed in the latest quarter on volume, price, mix, margin — with numbers? |
| **Thesis pillars** | Always | What 2–4 **structural** drivers (not hope) carry the return case — each quantified? |
| **Reversionary pricing / cost gap** | Regulated tariffs, legacy contracts, peer margin gap | What rolls off or closes on a known timeline? |
| **Normalized earnings** | Cycle, M&A, one-offs | What is run-rate EPS/FCF after pro forma adjustments? |
| **Valuation bridge** | Always | ≥2 methods; base case shows explicit annualized return math |
| **Hohn return bar** | Stance / accumulate decision | Does base case clear ~15% medium-term with ~10% downside on bear case? |
| **Primary risk** | Always | What single factor breaks the thesis? |
| **Fieldwork delta** | After earnings, investor day, mgmt meeting | What did we learn that sell-side or filings underweight? |
| **Disintermediation watch** | Platforms, payments, distribution | What channel could bypass the franchise — and why might it fail? |
| **Hidden / zero-valued asset** | Holdcos, conglomerates, optionality | Is value priced at zero inside the multiple? |
| **Capital return capacity** | Cash-rich, regulated, buyback stories | What can balance sheet return without hurting moat? |

**Sources:** `tci/Hohn-Analysis-Framework-extract.txt`, …

### Optionality — floor + catalyst (Marvin overlay)

Full template: `_system/frameworks/optionality_valuation.md`. Use when Lawrence/Hohn base IRR understates asymmetric payoffs.

| Model | Trigger | Question |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Holdco SOTP + catalyst stack** | FRMO; private marks below fair | What is look-through NAV vs price? Named IPO/listing catalysts and timeline? |
| **Mineral floor + free option** | KEWL; land/royalty microcaps | What is book/cash floor if production = 0? Option yield if named project hits? |
| **HK royalty curve (normalized)** | MSB, SJT; trust distribution gaps | What is **normalized** yield — not single depressed quarter? Equity yield curve over legal recovery? |
| **Transitory bonus / dist gap** | Royalty trusts | Is the gap contractual/mechanical with precedent (Mesabi/SJT)? |
| **Market structure discount** | OTC royalty trusts | Is mispricing from index/yield exclusion, not fundamentals? |
| **Pabrai low risk / high uncertainty** | Optionality at asset floor | Is uncertainty high but fundamental risk low (cash, no debt, passive trust)? |

### Munger — Compounders

| Model | Trigger | Question |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Moat durability** | Archetype = compounder / serial_acquirer | Can rational managers defend pricing power over long periods? |
| **Moat trajectory** | Same | Is the moat widening, stable, or eroding — not just this year's EPS? |

### Pabrai — Compounders & special situations

| Model | Trigger | Question |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Cloning + verify** | Idea from another investor | Did I independently verify from primary sources before capital? |
| **Cloning conviction score** | `superinvestor_signal` moi_bucket | Position size, style congruence, letter commentary, turnover lag — macro basket disqualifies endorsement |
| **Concentration vs capacity** | Portfolio sizing | Is this high-conviction enough for concentration given fund/portfolio constraints? |
| **One-decision stock** | `core` stance on compounders | Could we hold 10–20 years — pricing power above inflation, minimal obsolescence? (MOI / Tarasoff) |

## Tier 3 — Horizon Kinetics / Stahl (situation-specific)

These models extend Stahl beyond croupiers. Full extracts: `horizon-kinetics/`; vault: `C:\Users\werdn\Documents\Investing\Horizon Kinetics\hk_pdfs\`.

| Model | Trigger | Question | Predictive tag |
|-------|---------|----------|----------------|
| **Equity yield curve** | Contractual or high-confidence future value + date (bankruptcy plan, callable preferred, NPI deficit paydown, utility settlement) | What annualized return does the market require for each month/year until realization? Is the discount >25–35% at 2–3 years? | `equity_yield_curve` |
| **Time arbitrage** | Same as equity yield curve | Am I willing to hold through interim uncertainty that institutional 12-month horizons avoid? | `equity_yield_curve` |
| **Predictive vs descriptive** | Screening / index inclusion | Am I relying on backward-looking stats (P/E, yield, GICS) or forward predispositions (dormancy, recovery timeline)? | — |
| **Dormant asset** | Land, unused rights, off-balance-sheet value | Is there value priced at zero in the earnings multiple until a catalyst reveals it? | `dormant_asset` |
| **Transitory problem** | Dividend suspension, temporary deficit, litigation overhang with bounded resolution | Is the impairment temporary and contractually/mechanically bounded? What is the Mesabi/PG&E precedent? | `transitory_problem` |
| **Market structure discount** | Royalty trust, LP/K-1, sub-index, yield-screen exclusion | Is disdain from institutions/yield databases creating persistent mispricing unrelated to fundamental risk? | `market_structure_discount` |
| **Inverted equity yield curve** | Growth priced for perfection | Does implied long-run scale require negative slope (eBay case)? Where is the sell point? | — |
| **Curve flattening** | Approaching known catalyst | As the event nears, does return compress toward T-bill (efficiency at the end)? Should I avoid chasing late? | `equity_yield_curve` |

### Equity yield curve — quick reference

1. Plot **expected annualized return** vs **years/months until value realization** (like a bond curve, steeper).
2. **Rarely plottable** — future stock price is subjective (NVIDIA growth debate).
3. **Plottable when:** dated recovery (bankruptcy emergence), callable preferred, NPI deficit erasure, regulatory settlement schedule.
4. **Observed steepness:** ~35% annualized at ~3 years in HK case studies; compresses near the event.
5. **Mechanism:** Institutional managers judged on 12-month relative returns — long-dated certain gains have low utility → lower price / higher yield for patient capital.

## Report integration

Deep dives and cross-checks should include:

```markdown
## Mental models applied

| Model | Finding (1 line) |
|-------|------------------|
| … | … |

**Predictive attribute:** equity_yield_curve | … | none
```

When an external doc is cited, also include `## Blended estimate (best judgment)` per `external_view_blend.md`.

Then standard **Classification** table (include Lawrence IRR fields when computed), **[HUMAN REVIEW]**, **[PROPOSED MEMORY]**.

## Maintenance

- New HK quarterly commentaries: add extract to `horizon-kinetics/`, update this file + `INDEX.md`.
- After human promotion, mirror key bullets in `MEMORY.md` — do not duplicate entire catalog there.
- Run `python _system/scripts/build_wisdom_manifest.py` after adding PDFs to wisdom folders.
