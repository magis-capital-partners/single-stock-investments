# VIC intake workflow

The former local bookmarklet/dashboard script is retired at `_system/scripts/attic/vic_local_intake.py`. Do not wire it into workflows or use the obsolete `_system/scripts/vic_local_intake.py` path.

## Supported route

For a VIC PDF the user already has:

```powershell
python _system/scripts/materialize_drive_credentials.py --require
python _system/scripts/drive_intake_drop.py --kind VIC --ticker TPL path\to\writeup.pdf
```

The uploader accepts only PDFs and existing repo ticker folders. It writes `Admin/Intake/VIC/{TICKER}/`, records a content hash, and returns `already_present` rather than duplicating an identical upload.

The Data Pipeline Drive job runs daily at 14:00 UTC. It imports the PDF to `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/vic/`, stages `research-vault/vic-research/{TICKER}/` (PDF gitignored; `.txt` extract committed), writes a `.source.json` sidecar, updates the Drive-ID manifest and source inventory, and records unresolved files in the GitHub job summary plus `_system/reference/document-store/drive_intake_latest.json`.

For text that cannot be represented as a PDF:

1. Write `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/vic/vic_{date}_{slug}_{hash}.md`.
2. Run `python _system/scripts/third_party_inventory.py TICKER`.
3. Commit the text and refreshed inventory through the normal branch/PR path.

Text-only intake does not pass through Drive. Optional vault copy: `python _system/scripts/vic_vault.py --backfill`.

## Boundaries

- No GitHub Actions workflow stores or uses VIC login credentials.
- No scheduled VIC crawl, login automation, or bulk retrieval is supported.
- VIC is a licensed corpus like SumZero. It belongs in research-vault `vic-research/` and in the ticker working folder.
- Unknown or ambiguous tickers are not guessed and do not create ticker folders.

## Status

VIC intakes are **context** on arrival. No per-writeup human approval. Cite as variant perception. Do not fold VIC numbers into base IRR, target price, or stance.
