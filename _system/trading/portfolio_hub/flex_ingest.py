"""Broker truth from IBKR Flex. No Gateway, no client ID, no polling.

This is the replacement for the collector that was masked on 2026-08-25 for
reconnect-storming the Gateway shared with the live SPX 0DTE executor
(CLAUDE.md rule 9). The difference is structural, not a tuning change:

  * Flex is an HTTPS report service. It cannot contend with SPX for a Gateway
    socket, an API client id, or a market-data line, because it uses none of
    them. There is no failure mode here that reaches the executor.
  * It reads XML that already exists on disk. ls-algo fetches these files once
    a day for its own accounting, so this path adds *zero* IBKR requests --
    not a smaller number of them, zero.
  * It runs once, after the close, and exits. Nothing is held open between runs.

It also removes the FX problem rather than fixing it. Flex states
`fxRateToBase` on every position row, so nothing is inferred; the collector had
to derive a rate from marketValue / (position x price) and got ~1.0 for every
foreign holding, publishing yen at dollar magnitudes.

A positions-only file stays `complete: false`. The read model serves only
complete runs, so publishing positions without a stated net liquidation would
put a positions book behind a cockpit that shows NAV and margin, and those
tiles would then be silently empty forever.

When the same file contains `EquitySummaryByReportDateInBase` (or a
`ChangeInNAV` row that states ending value), those stated amounts become
account values and the snapshot is complete. Margin tags stay absent until a
Flex section actually states them. Adding that equity-summary section is a
Client Portal change to the positions query; this path only reads the XML
already on disk.
