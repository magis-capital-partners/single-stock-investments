"""Hub-side command loop: pull requests, decide locally, transmit locally.

Direction of trust matters more than the mechanics here. The edge never calls
the hub; the hub calls the edge. A compromised Cloudflare function, a stolen
session cookie, or a bug in a Worker can at most create a *request* row. It
cannot reach IB Gateway, cannot approve, and cannot transmit, because the
approval secret and the broker socket both live only on this machine.

The loop is a translation between two state machines:

    edge request row              hub GuardedOrderService
    ----------------              -----------------------
    requested        ->           create()  -> Draft
                                  preview() -> Previewed   (live NBBO + whatIf)
    previewed        <-           issue_approval()          (token stays here)
    approved         ->           approve() + submit()      -> Acknowledged
    acknowledged     <-           broker status / executions

Timing is the constraint that shapes everything. GuardedOrderService enforces
`quote_max_age_seconds` (10s) and `approval_ttl_seconds` (120s), so the preview
cannot be precomputed or cached, and the whole preview -> human -> submit round
trip has to fit inside two minutes *including* both poll latencies. A cron would
miss every time. While a ticket is *recently* open the loop runs at
ACTIVE_POLL_SECONDS; otherwise it backs off to IDLE_POLL_SECONDS.
