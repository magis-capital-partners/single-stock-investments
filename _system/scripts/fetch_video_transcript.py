"""Fetch published captions for discovered videos. Captions only -- never audio.

Phase 2 of the video lane. The podcast pipeline tries a published transcript
first and falls back to Whisper on the audio; this one has no fallback and that
is deliberate. Audio download was ruled out, so a video without captions is
dropped rather than transcribed. That single constraint removes the ToS
question, removes the 30-minutes-of-CPU-per-item cost that has the podcast
analysis queue 29 days deep, and keeps this job cheap enough to run beside the
Whisper backfill without competing with it.

**No audio path exists here, and a test enforces that.** `yt-dlp` is installed on
this box and would happily fetch a stream; the guard is that no call site may
exist, in the same spirit as the `reqGlobalCancel` ban in the trading code.

Three mechanical gates, applied before a video is admitted to the corpus. None
of them is a *relevance* judgement -- that is the transcript gate, and it comes
next:

  * **Duration.** Under the floor it is a clip or a trailer.
  * **Length.** A transcript too short to contain an argument.
  * **Coverage.** chars-per-minute below the floor means the caption track does
    not actually cover the video -- a partial track, a music segment, or an
    intro-only caption. This is the video analogue of the podcast corpus finding
    that 97% of what looked like transcripts were MP3s wearing a .txt extension:
    the file existed and was the wrong thing, and only reading the content said so.

The 25,000-byte podcast floor deliberately does NOT transfer. A 10-minute Sohn
pitch measured 10,359 characters on 2026-09-01 -- a genuine single-name pitch
that the podcast threshold would have thrown away. Podcast episodes run 45-90
minutes; conference pitches are short and dense.
