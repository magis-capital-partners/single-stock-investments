"""Collapse the [PROPOSED] backlog in daily logs into one reviewable queue.

Marvin proposes memory updates as `[PROPOSED …]` blocks in
`_system/memory/daily/{date}.md`; a promotion pass moves approved items into
`_system/memory/MEMORY.md`. The proposing side has run for months and the
promoting side has not, so the belief set freezes while proposals accumulate.
Reading them in place means opening every daily file, which is why it has not
happened.

This writes a single file grouped by lens (MUNGER / PABRAI / STAHL / MOI /
COMPANY / …), newest first, with an `- [ ]` marker and a stable `id` per item,
so promotion is one pass with checkboxes rather than dozens of file reads.

**Decision ledger.** Until 2026-08-09 the queue had no memory of its own: items
promoted in May 2026 were still sitting unticked in the August queue, so every
build re-surfaced work already done and the reviewer had to re-reject the same
noise. `_system/memory/triage_ledger.json` now records a decision per item id;
Decided items are excluded from the next build; no history is deleted.
Disposition changes are appended to `_system/memory/triage_events.jsonl`; the JSON ledger is
a current-state projection. Pass `--show-decided` to inspect handled proposals.

It does **not** promote anything into MEMORY.md. Promotion is the human owner's;
an agent may run a promotion pass only when the human asks for one in that
session, and every agent-promoted belief is stamped as such in MEMORY.md.

Cadence: rebuild daily (and after any promotion pass), then record decisions
so the next build starts from the undecided remainder. See the header of
`_system/memory/MEMORY.md`.
