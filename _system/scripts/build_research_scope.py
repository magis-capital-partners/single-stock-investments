"""Refresh the Research Watchdog's scope from the daily IBKR Flex statement.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `research_watchdog.py` ranks findings by capital at risk, and
its scope came from `positions.json` - a sleeve-desk file written by the
collector that was deleted on 2026-08-25 for reconnect-storming the Gateway
(CLAUDE.md rule 9). Nothing has refreshed it since, so the watchdog was ranking
a frozen book while reading as current.

NO GATEWAY, NO NETWORK. This reads an XML file that ls-algo already fetches once
a day for its own accounting, at
`/home/spx/ls-algo/data/runs/<date>/ibkr_flex/flex_positions.xml`. It adds zero
IBKR requests - not fewer, zero - opens no socket, and takes no client id.

FX IS STATED, NOT INFERRED. Flex puts `fxRateToBase` on every row. The old
collector derived a rate from marketValue / (position x price), which on this
account returned ~1.0 for every foreign holding because marketValue already came
back in the contract currency - so yen and pence were published at dollar
magnitudes. Here CAD 801,879 at 0.71217 becomes USD 571,074 because IBKR said so.

BUCKETS ARE CARRIED FORWARD, NOT RECOMPUTED. This is the important one.
`OpenPosition` rows carry no `orderRef`, and `model` is empty on all 536 rows of
the real statement, so Flex cannot distinguish a share of AAPL that Michael owns
from one ls-algo owns. Recomputing with `classify_position` would resolve every
name in ls-algo's 924-symbol universe to `etf_ls` - moving APLD, AXP, BRK B and
SMR out of the research book purely because a systematic strategy also trades
them. So a symbol that already has a bucket keeps it, and a symbol that does not
is classified fresh AND listed under `needs_review` rather than silently
assigned.

Usage:
  python _system/scripts/build_research_scope.py --flex <flex_positions.xml>
  python _system/scripts/build_research_scope.py --flex <xml> --summary
  python _system/scripts/build_research_scope.py --latest-run <runs_dir>
