.SYNOPSIS
    Keep the Whisper backfill draining on this host until the backlog is empty.

.DESCRIPTION
    The daemon is deliberately quittable -- it stops on a deadline, after six
    barren rounds, or on any unhandled error -- because a process that must run
    for days will be killed at some point and the design prefers that to be
    survivable. That makes it correct but not persistent. This supervisor is the
    other half: it restarts the daemon until the work is actually finished.

    Single instance is the property that matters most here. On 2026-08-25 two
    daemons ran against the same backlog from different hosts and roughly a
    third of all transcription was thrown away -- both machines transcribing the
    same episode, each overwriting the other, and the vault push racing between
    them. A global mutex makes that impossible on this host; keeping only one
    host scheduled is the operator's half of the same rule.

    Restarts back off. A daemon that exits immediately is usually telling you
    the network is down or the vault is unreachable, and hammering it turns one
    outage into thousands of journal lines -- which is exactly how an earlier
    retry loop produced 6,785 restarts in a day.

.PARAMETER Model
    Whisper checkpoint. distil-large-v3 is the default: benchmarked on this box
    at 4.3x realtime, faster than `small` AND more accurate, and the only tested
    config that preserves negations rather than inverting them.

.PARAMETER Threads
    CPU threads for CTranslate2. Left at 12 of 16 so the machine stays usable.

.PARAMETER SyncMain
    Bring this worktree up to origin/main before any Python runs. The
    scheduled task passes it and runs the script from the ssi-local-lanes
    worktree, never the primary checkout; lane_worktree.ps1 has the reasons.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File _system\scripts\whisper_supervisor.ps1
