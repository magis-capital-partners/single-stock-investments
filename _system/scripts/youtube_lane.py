"""Run the YouTube research lane end to end, on this host rather than in CI.

The lane was written for `youtube-refresh.yml`, which pins itself to a
`self-hosted, linux, youtube-egress` runner so caption traffic leaves from a
stable residential IP instead of a hosted datacenter one. That runner was never
registered: `GET /actions/runners` returns zero, so every scheduled run has sat
`queued` until the next night's run displaced it. The lane has therefore never
executed in CI at all, while reading as "not failed" the whole time -- a queued
job shows no red X anywhere.

Registering that runner was considered and rejected on 2026-09-06. This
repository is **public**, and a self-hosted runner on a public repository lets
any fork pull request execute code on the host. The host in question is the
operator's workstation: it holds `_secrets/`, a research-vault push token, and
sits on the same network as the trading systems. The egress IP the label exists
to provide is this machine's already, so running the lane directly gives up
nothing and removes the exposure entirely.

**Runs from its own worktree, not the primary checkout.** Concurrent agents
share the main working tree here, and a lane that stages files into a shared
index eventually has them swept into somebody else's commit. `git worktree`
gives a separate index and HEAD while sharing the 21 GB object store, so
isolation costs ~1 GB of sparse checkout rather than a 14 GB second clone.
The worktree pulls `main` at the start of every run: the NY4 hub is a file copy
with no `.git`, and the silent drift that produced is not worth repeating.

**Whisper is opt-in and off by default.** The CI job routes caption-less videos
through local Whisper at `--batch 4`. On this box that would be a third
competitor for memory alongside the podcast Whisper backfill and the analysis
batch, which already leave under 1 GB free; the analyser's own logs show it
waiting on a 600 MB floor. Videos without captions are queued and left queued
until someone asks for them.
