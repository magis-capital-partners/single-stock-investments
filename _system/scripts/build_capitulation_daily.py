"""Always-on DAILY-bar capitulation model for the risk page's pressure rails.

Why this exists
---------------
The published "mechanical pressure / exhaustion" rails are a model of how far
into capitulation a selloff has progressed. That model lives in
``_system/scripts/criticality/flow_stress.py`` and is driven by a Databento
streaming monitor that runs on the owner's machine over intraday MINUTE bars.
When that machine is off, the rails are empty -- they were empty for a week
from 2026-08-03.

This builder runs the SAME model on DAILY bars inside CI, so the panel always
has an honest reading. The intraday feed becomes an enrichment (faster, finer)
rather than a single point of failure.

No forked math
--------------
Every score here comes from ``flow_stress.calculate_flow_snapshot`` and every
ladder transition from that same function plus
``flow_stress.apply_state_hysteresis``. This module contains NO copy of the
component weights and NO copy of the state thresholds. A second copy would
drift; ``test_build_capitulation_daily.py`` asserts the two agree bar-for-bar
on a synthetic series.

Reinterpretations on daily bars (each one deliberate and documented)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
``calculate_flow_snapshot`` expresses every window as a COUNT OF BARS, so the
reinterpretation is exactly "bar = session" instead of "bar = minute":

1. return_stress_z    -- 5-minute return vs the 30-minute per-bar sigma
                      -> 5-SESSION return vs the 30-SESSION per-bar sigma.
2. vol acceleration   -- realized vol over 5 vs 30 minutes
                      -> realized vol over 5 vs 30 SESSIONS.
3. downside variance share and negative-return share
                      -- last 15 minutes -> last 15 SESSIONS.
4. volume z / range z -- last bar vs the prior 60 minutes
                      -> last SESSION vs the prior 60 SESSIONS.
5. positive_interval  -- close > open within the minute
                      -> close > open within the SESSION.
6. closed_upper_half / close_location
                      -- close location inside the current MINUTE's high-low
                      -> close location inside the DAY's high-low range.
7. volatility_decelerating / selling_decelerating
                      -- 5-minute realized vol / 5-minute return vs the prior
                         5-minute block -> the same over 5-SESSION blocks.
8. volume_cooling     -- today's volume below the max of the last 10 MINUTES
                      -> below the max of the last 10 SESSIONS.

Nothing is reweighted, because nothing had to be dropped: all six pressure
components, all four panic components and all five exhaustion confirmations are
computable on daily bars.

The one genuinely intraday output is OMITTED rather than silently reinterpreted:
``vol_target`` (the vol-targeting exposure-reduction proxy) compares an
ANNUALIZED realized vol against 8/10/12% targets, and ``flow_stress``
annualizes with ``MINUTES_PER_YEAR``. That constant cancels out of every score
this module publishes -- ``volatility_acceleration`` is a ratio of two
annualized vols, and ``minute_sigma = rv30 / sqrt(MINUTES_PER_YEAR)`` is just
the per-bar standard deviation -- but it does NOT cancel out of ``vol_target``.
Republishing that block off daily bars would state a wrong number in percent,
so this payload does not carry it at all.

Prices are dividend-adjusted (Yahoo adjclose ratio applied to OHLC), matching
``build_technical_signals.fetch_yahoo_history``, so a distribution date is not
read as a one-day selloff.

Drawdown context -- the honesty property
----------------------------------------
Capitulation only means something inside a selloff. "Exhaustion 95" at
all-time highs is not a bottom signal, it is a quiet up-day: four of the five
exhaustion confirmations (close in the upper half, vol decelerating, selling
decelerating, volume cooling) fire on any calm advance. The current dashboard
shows exactly that nonsense today.

So every row carries ``drawdown_pct`` from the trailing 252-session closing
high, ``days_since_high``, and ``in_drawdown`` (threshold: drawdown at or below
-5.0%, ``IN_DRAWDOWN_THRESHOLD_PCT``), and ``exhaustion_meaningful`` is False
unless BOTH:

* the raw (pre-hysteresis) ladder state is at least ``stress`` -- i.e. panic
  cleared the ladder's stress threshold. This is expressed as a STATE_RANK
  comparison against the imported ladder rather than a copied ``panic >= 70``,
  so the two can never disagree; and
* the symbol is in drawdown.

``exhaustion_meaningful_reason`` always names which gate decided.

Outputs (``--output-dir``, default ``dashboard/data``)
-----------------------------------------------------
* ``capitulation_daily.json``       -- market / symbols / sectors snapshot.
* ``capitulation_daily_history.jsonl`` -- one market-level (SPY) row per date,
  idempotent by date, so the ladder can be charted over time.
* ``capitulation_daily_state.json``  -- hysteresis memory, one
  ``apply_state_hysteresis``-shaped record per symbol plus the ``as_of`` it was
  last advanced on. Dwell is counted in TRADING DATES, so re-running the
  builder twice in one day cannot walk the ladder twice.

Failure policy: a per-symbol fetch failure preserves the prior published row
and stamps it ``quality_state='stale'`` /
``fetch_status='preserved_after_fetch_failure'`` (same contract as
``build_criticality_signals.py``). The process always exits 0: this lane also
commits the technical snapshots, and a vendor hiccup must not skip that.
