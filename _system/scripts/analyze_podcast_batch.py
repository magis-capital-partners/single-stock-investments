"""Run the local-model analysis across the transcript corpus, safely and resumably.

Companion to analyze_podcast_episode.py, which handles one episode. This handles
the other 460 and the things that only matter at that scale: not losing work, not
redoing it, not starving the machine, and not being the reason a trading
workstation swaps.

**Resumable by content, not by name.** Each result records the SHA-1 of the
transcript it was derived from. An episode is skipped only when that hash still
matches, so re-transcribing an episode -- which this corpus does, as Whisper
drains and name repair rewrites -- correctly invalidates the old analysis
instead of silently keeping a summary of text that no longer exists.

**Checkpointed to the vault.** An unpushed result is an unbacked-up one. The
whisper daemon learned this the expensive way: transcripts sat locally for five
hours because its push interval was evaluated per chunk rather than per episode.
Here the interval is checked after every episode.

**Yields rather than competes.** Two things run on this box already -- the
whisper backfill on 12 CPU threads and llama-server holding the model. Available
memory was 1.4 GB when this was written, with commit charge at 84 of 99 GB. So
the loop checks free memory before each episode and waits rather than pushing the
machine into swap, and the process asks for BELOW_NORMAL priority. Inference
itself runs on the GPU, so the cost here is mostly waiting on HTTP; the guard is
for the case where that assumption stops holding.

**Single instance.** Two analysers over one corpus would duplicate work and race
each other's vault pushes, which is exactly what two whisper daemons did on
2026-08-25 -- a third of a night's transcription discarded.
