"""Executable health contract over the workspace graph (_system/graph/README.md).

Rebuilds ``_system/graph/graph.db`` via ``graph_build.build()`` (projection,
never a store), runs every invariant P1-P5 / E1-E6 as SQL and traversals over
the fresh database, writes ``_system/graph/INVARIANTS.md`` (small, diffable --
the committed artifact whose git history is the ratchet record) plus
``invariants.json`` next to it, and exits 1 iff any hard invariant has live
violations.

Honesty rules baked in (a validator must never look green on data it never saw):

  * E2 with zero typed falsifiers reports ``vacuously green (0 typed)``
    explicitly, and E3 with zero outcomes ``vacuously green (0 outcomes)`` --
    never a plain OK.
  * Severity demotions and per-violation waivers live in
    ``_system/graph/graph_sources.json`` under ``invariants``, each with a
    dated note, and are printed in the report -- never silent.
  * A waiver that matches no live violation is itself reported as stale
    (a waiver that cannot fire is a check that cannot fail, one level up).

Output is ASCII-only (Windows cp1252 console; the recorded trap).

Environment: ``GRAPH_LANE_REF`` -- git ref that ``graph_build`` projects lanes
and commits from (default HEAD). ``run()`` sets it to ``origin/main`` for the
duration of the build whenever that ref exists and the variable is not already
set, because P3 fires spuriously on PR checkouts whose branch point is older
than a lane's freshness window: the nightly lane commits land on main and are
absent from the PR head's own history. An explicitly set value is respected
untouched; the variable is unset again after the build so nothing leaks into
later builds against other roots.

# valuation run, not a classification change. On 2026-09-08 the Power Zone run
# valued five aggregates producers (ACA, AMRZ, EXP, ROAD, USLM), all carrying the
