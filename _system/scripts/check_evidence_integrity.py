"""Find evidence that is blocked without anything saying so.

`check_evidence_completeness.py` answers "is this one ticker's contract
internally valid." It cannot answer the question that actually bit us on WHK:
*which tickers are stuck in a way no status field admits to?* WHK's contract
read `decision_grade` with zero blockers while its compiler stage read
`evidence_blocked`, its eight evidence tasks sat at `attempts: 0`, and
`build_contract_backfill_queue.py` skipped it precisely *because* it was
decision_grade -- so the automation that would have collected the missing
facts could never see it. Every individual artifact looked fine. The defect
was only visible in the disagreement *between* artifacts.

This sweep encodes those disagreements as checks over the whole universe.
Each check is a pairwise contradiction between two files that are supposed to
agree, or a queue that claims to be working and is not:

  V1  contract says decision_grade, compiler stage says evidence_blocked
  V2  decision_grade with no sourced fact node anywhere in its proofs
  V3  evidence tasks pending_collection with attempts: 0 on a stale queue
  V4  routed primary method not satisfied by the executed component proofs
  V5  component results present but no totals -> dashboard renders null
  V6  decision_grade with no typed falsifier -> monitoring cannot fire
  V7  decision_grade whose routed method inputs are absent from the ledger

V3 additionally reports the *trap*, which is the finding that motivated this
sweep. Three separate remediation paths all gate on the same field:

  build_contract_backfill_queue.py  skips status == "decision_grade"
  build_evidence_recovery_queue.py  skips status == "decision_grade" under
                                    its default `all-blocked` scope
  run_security_decision_pipeline    only opens committees on decision_grade

so a contract that reaches `decision_grade` prematurely is simultaneously
treated as finished by every path that could have finished it. 124 tickers
were in that state when this was written, and none of them appeared in either
queue. `decision_grade` is load-bearing as a completion signal and nothing
was checking that it had been earned.

Two checks deliberately measure something narrower than they first appear:

  * V2 counts proof nodes of `kind: fact` carrying a source, NOT the
    contract's `input_classification.facts`. That array is empty for 187 of
    192 decision-grade contracts because `_input_kind` classifies a whole
    component as "judgment" when *any* of its inputs is a judgment -- which
    every real model has. Counting it would report 187 defects that are not
    defects. The honest count is 1.
  * V4 mirrors `compile_existing_approved_proofs`'s own `route_supported`
    rule exactly rather than approximating it, because that function's return
    value is the consequence being detected: when the route is unsatisfied it
    returns None, the issuer's authored proofs are discarded, and the ticker
    is silently recompiled from the normalized ledger on every run.

V6 overlaps graph invariant E1 by design and at a different grain: E1 counts
decision-grade *components* lacking a typed falsifier, V6 counts *tickers*
with none at all. E1 is the coverage ratchet; V6 is the triage list.

Severity is deliberately `report` with a ratchet, not `hard`. 124 tickers were
trapped when this was written; failing CI on that would freeze the factory,
which the graph README already identifies as the worse failure. Instead the
baseline in `_system/data/evidence_integrity_baseline.json` records today's
counts and the check fails only when a count *rises* above its baseline. The
numbers can then only go down.
