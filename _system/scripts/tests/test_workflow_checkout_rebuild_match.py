"""No workflow may ask a ticker-less checkout for a ticker rebuild.

This exact mismatch broke two scheduled lanes and neither was noticed for weeks:

  letter-backfill.yml  `pages`  profile -> build_dashboard_data.py  (4 runs, 2 weeks)
  darwin-refresh.yml   `darwin` profile -> build_dashboard_data.py  (12 days)

build_dashboard_data.py walks the per-ticker trees to compute pdf_count, readme,
research_dir, sec_filings and friends. A checkout without those trees makes all
of them compute to zero, and the script's clobber guard then refuses to write --
correctly, because the alternative is shipping 833 tickers with gutted infra
stats to the live dashboard.

That guard is the last line, not the first. It fires at the END of a long rebuild
chain (letter-backfill spent ~43 minutes reaching it, 40 of them inside
build_superinvestor_insights.py) to report a precondition knowable from the
workflow file alone. This test reads it from the workflow file alone.

**"Sparse" is not the test.** `marvin-pick` is sparse and ships 1,666 ticker
research paths; `news` ships 833. Those workflows rebuild fine, and a test that
flagged them would be a false positive that someone would rightly delete. The
question is only ever whether the profile actually yields ticker trees, so this
asks ci_sparse_checkout_paths.py -- the same source of truth CI uses -- rather
than hardcoding a list that would rot the moment a profile changed.
