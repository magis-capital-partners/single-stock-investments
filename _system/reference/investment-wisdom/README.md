# Investment Wisdom Library

Curated PDF writings for Marvin's mental-model layer: **Charlie Munger**, **Mohnish Pabrai**, **Murray Stahl**, and **Horizon Kinetics** extracts.

**Path:** `_system/reference/investment-wisdom/`

Marvin should cite these files by path when applying frameworks. Primary company research still lives in ticker folders; this library is for **how to think**, not **what we hold**.

**Catalog:** `_system/frameworks/mental_models.md` — tiered mental models with triggers and questions.

## Stahl source vault

The full Murray Stahl / Horizon Kinetics archive (400+ PDFs) remains at:

`C:\Users\werdn\Documents\Investing\Horizon Kinetics\hk_pdfs\`

The **stahl/** folder includes the compilation PDF (hard-linked) plus key thematic essays. **horizon-kinetics/** holds curated text extracts for equity yield curve and recent commentaries. See `horizon-kinetics/README.md` and `stahl/` + `INDEX.md` for chapter-level mapping to the manuscript at `Horizon Kinetics/hk_pdfs/book/manuscript/`.

## Human promotion

Distilled beliefs from these writings are promoted to `_system/memory/MEMORY.md` under genius-specific sections after review — never written directly by Marvin during sessions.
