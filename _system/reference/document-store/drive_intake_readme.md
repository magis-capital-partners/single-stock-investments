# Drive Intake

Ticker-shaped PDFs only (VIC, outside research, company decks, activist). Fund letters and books use a different route: `_system/agents/MICHAEL.md`.

Use this Shared Drive folder as the repo drop zone:

- Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OBaWt7SF-OME8hmXkl7tzdFLAfjBrp_C
- Path on Shared Drive: `Admin/Intake`
- Label: Single Stock Research PDF Store
- Service account: `pdf-store-uploader@single-stock-pdf-store.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- Workflow: the `Data Pipeline` Drive job is scheduled daily at 14:00 UTC. GitHub Actions may start scheduled work later than the nominal cron time.

The live Drive layout is under `Admin/Intake` by intake type:

```text
Admin/
  Intake/
    VIC/
      TPL.pdf
      FRMI.pdf
    Research/
      TPL.pdf
    Company/
      TPL.pdf
```

## Grok / CLI drop

Cloud Grok and local agents can upload without clicking Drive:

```powershell
python _system/scripts/materialize_drive_credentials.py --require
python _system/scripts/drive_intake_drop.py --kind VIC --ticker TPL path\to\writeup.pdf
```

Requires `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`, `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` (Cloud Agent secret), or `_secrets/google-service-account.json`. Repeating the same file is safe: the uploader checks its content hash and returns `already_present` instead of creating another Drive object. VIC also stages into research-vault `vic-research/{TICKER}/` on the daily import (PDF gitignored; text extract committed). Prompt: `_system/agents/GROK.md`.

## Where To Drop PDFs

Ticker subfolders are also accepted:

```text
Admin/
  Intake/
    VIC/
      TPL/
        VIC writeup.pdf
    Research/
      TPL/
        outside report.pdf
    Company/
      TPL/
        company presentation.pdf
    Activist/
      Long/
        DIS/
          elliott-proxy-letter.pdf
      Short/
        APLD/
          hindenburg-report.pdf
```

Use the exact repo ticker folder name, for example `TPL`, `FRMO`, `0388.HK`, or `TEQ.ST`.

For the flat layout, put the ticker as the filename or as the first clear filename token, such as `TPL.pdf` or `TPL - outside report.pdf`.

Arbitrary filenames (including bare VIC ids such as `163625.pdf`) are also accepted when the PDF text uniquely identifies a repo ticker. The importer extracts text (pypdf, with optional OCR fallback), resolves a single ticker, imports locally, and moves the Drive file under `Admin/Intake/{Kind}/{TICKER}/`. Ambiguous or unreadable PDFs stay in place and appear under `warnings` in `drive_intake_latest.json` (non-fatal).

## Routing

- `Admin/Intake/VIC/{TICKER}.pdf` (or `VIC/{TICKER}.pdf` relative to the intake root) imports to `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/vic/`
- `Admin/Intake/Research/{TICKER}.pdf` imports to `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/drive-intake/`
- `Admin/Intake/Company/{TICKER}.pdf` imports to `{TICKER}/investor-documents/drive-intake/`
- `Admin/Intake/Activist/Long/{TICKER}/*.pdf` imports to `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/activist_reports/long/`
- `Admin/Intake/Activist/Short/{TICKER}/*.pdf` imports to `{TICKER}/third-party-analyses/activist_reports/short/`

The older `Admin/{VIC,Research,Company}/...` layout is still accepted if those folders exist.

After local import, the normal registry/upload step links the PDFs back into the PDF store folders used by the dashboard:

- VIC: `Single Stocks/{TICKER}/VIC/`
- Research: `Single Stocks/{TICKER}/Research/drive-intake/`
- Company: `Single Stocks/{TICKER}/Company/drive-intake/`
- Activist long: `Single Stocks/{TICKER}/Activist/long/`
- Activist short: `Single Stocks/{TICKER}/Activist/short/`

## Automation Flow

1. Drop PDFs into the appropriate Drive intake folder.
2. The daily Data Pipeline Drive job scans the configured intake root, creates missing intake folders, and imports new PDFs.
3. Each imported PDF gets a `.source.json` sidecar with Drive source metadata.
4. `_system/data/drive_intake_manifest.json` records Drive file IDs so the same file is not imported again.
5. For touched tickers, the importer rebuilds the third-party source inventory. When at least one file imports, the workflow runs the `insights` profile, which refreshes insights, research memory, and dashboard data.
6. The 03:00 UTC `intake-full` lane performs the full document-registry, Drive filename/link, PDF-store audit, and PDF-store synchronization work. The Drive intake job does not duplicate that full rebuild.
7. The workflow commits the imported documents and rebuilt dashboard artifacts back to `main`.
8. Warning/error counts and unresolved paths are written to the GitHub job summary. A changed warning state is committed to `_system/reference/document-store/drive_intake_latest.json` even when no PDF imports; identical daily state does not create another commit.

## Required GitHub Secret

Drive folder access alone is not enough for GitHub Actions. The repo also needs an Actions secret named `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` containing the full JSON key for `pdf-store-uploader@single-stock-pdf-store.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.

The Drive job fails if this required secret is missing. It does not report a successful no-op.

## Rules

- Upload PDFs only.
- Leave files in Drive after upload; the manifest prevents duplicate imports.
- Use existing repo tickers. Unknown / ambiguous PDFs (after content resolve) are reported as `warnings` in `_system/reference/document-store/drive_intake_latest.json`; operational failures remain `errors`.
- Use `--strict` on `import_drive_intake.py` to fail the run when any warning remains (local debugging).
- Use `VIC` only for Value Investors Club writeups; use `Research` for other outside research PDFs; use `Company` for company presentations or manually collected company PDFs; use `Activist/Long` or `Activist/Short` for activist letters, proxy fights, and forensic short reports.
